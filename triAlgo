for each face on the shape
	divide into triangles, and define an order of points

transform the points of the shape

for each transformed face
	if order of face points != order of original points
		face is a back face, ignore
	else
		face is front face, keep

to determine order of points, get order of points from top to bottom (based on y values)
	if y vals are the same, get the one with the largest x val first, then its neighbour
