Graphics Pipeline


This project is a python implementation of a graphics pipeline. This includes generating a shape mesh, performing perspective transformations, and applying back-face culling, hidden surface removal, and clipping.

This program can create 3 different meshes, and a combined scene. The shapes are a Cube, a Cone, and a Cylinder.

To run the program, the command line arguments are as follows: ./a1.py <type> <mesh> <resolution> <size>

<type>: the shape to create, can be one of cube, cone, cylinder, scene
<mesh>: the type of mesh to be created, currently only works for tri
<resolution>: the resolution of the mesh, which determines how many polygons are on each face. Must be an integer that is smaller than <size>
<size>: the size of the image, determining the volumetric area to generate the shape within. Must be an integer that is larger than <resolution>

TODO:
	- Fix the polygon mesh functionality
	- Fix the back face culling
